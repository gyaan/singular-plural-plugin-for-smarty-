This is smarty plugin for dealing with singular and plural form of word.
This is very helpful when you want to display any word singular and plural form according to count .

Take example : 
a)1 bangalore hotel or 123 bangalore hotels
b)1 bangalore package or 345 bangalore packages 

every time its not good to write if else for each word.

This help me a lot during integration with html teplates.
